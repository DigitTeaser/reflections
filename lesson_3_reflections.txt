When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Fill in your answer here
    When I need to collaborate with others or I am in mobile working, I need a 
    remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Fill in your answer here
    Because what I was doing locally might be different from the remote, auto-pull
    would make a mess to my local repository, like create hugh conflictions or 
    lose my work. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fill in your answer here
    Forks are the clones on Github remote repository, while clones are in local. 
    And branch is a concept in repository, not between repositories scale.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Fill in your answer here
    Git can tell whether it's fast-forward merge or not, when I pull remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Fill in your answer here
    Without version control, I think it's hard to collaborate in a project. Maybe 
    our work flow must be linear so that we don't create any confliction.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Fill in your answer here
    When I develop something needs others to discuss with and decide together, I
    will use a branch, it won't break master. On the other hand, use master directly
    is much easy to operate on Github.
